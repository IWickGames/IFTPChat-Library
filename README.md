# IFTPChat Library
 A easy way to setup FTP chatting or local network chats within your programs using a easy call by command line

How to use;

file.bat/exe [arg] [data]


   -send [message]             : Send a message no "" if its in the message it will be sent
   -list                       : List the chat
   -listfile [Filename]        : Outputs the list into a file no ""
   -setserverftp [Server]      : Sets the ftp server to connect to. No "" Ex: 192.168.1.2
   -setserverlocal [Server]    : Set the local server. No "" Ex: \\192.168.1.2\servername\folder
   -help                       : Display the help page

To create the iftpchat folder just send a message for the first time to generate the folder!

Step 1;
Download the bat or exe file and place it where you want

Step 2;
filename.bat/exe -setserverlocal [server]

Step 3;
Send a message because your done already! Now you have a chat room that you can use with any program by calling the commands to console!

Send a message by typing this
filename.bat/exe -send [message]

To view the messages do;
filename.bat/exe -list/-listfile [filename]

Use -listfile if you want to save the chats to a file. Also when using this command the filename data value comes in to play with -list you will not need it!
